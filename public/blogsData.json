        "content":"The software supply chain faces threats from all sides. A 2024 report by the Ponemon Institute found that over half of organizations have experienced a software supply chain attack, with 54% having experienced one within the past year. Supply chain attacks typically target services from third-party vendors or open source software that make up a company’s tech stack, and they can financially devastate an organization. According to a Juniper Research study, supply chain cyberattacks could cost the global economy almost $81 billion in lost revenue and damages by 2026. The White House has indicated a commitment to addressing the broader issue of software supply chain security, openly declaring it a national security problem and releasing an executive order aimed at establishing mitigatory standards. The threat has fueled the demand for platforms that can be used to detect — and, in a perfect world, mitigate — attacks on a business’ software supply chain. One startup creating such a platform, Lineaje (a semi-phonetic spelling of “lineage”), today closed a $20 million Series A funding round. Founded in 2021 by Javed Hasan and Anand Revashetti, Lineaje develops tools to detect software in an organization’s supply chain that’s been tampered with, as well as outdated, potentially vulnerable open source software. Once Lineaje finds a likely vulnerability, it recommends fixes — if any are available — and warns against implementing those that might break the software. “For organizations that care about the risk their software creates for their organizations as well as their customers, focusing and managing this risk is critical,” Hasan, Lineaje’s CEO, told TechCrunch. “Lineaje was born to discover, manage and secure software irrespective of where it’s built.” Both Hasan and Revashetti hail from the cybersecurity industry, having worked at vendors including Symantec, McAfee and Norton. They crossed paths while at McAfee, where Revashetti was a fellow and chief architect. “Software supply chain attacks and concerns have been steadily increasing,” Hasan said. “As we looked at this space, it was clear that that supply chain was a top-three concern for CISOs and the U.S. government.” Lineaje occupies a crowded market. Kusari, Ox Security, Chainguard, Dustico and Endor are among its rivals, and big tech companies such as Google, Amazon and Microsoft are mounting efforts to improve general open source software security. But one way Lineaje is attempting to stand out is by embracing defense work. Hasan claims that the company has a contract with the U.S. Air Force to support its “Eagle Eyes” anti-terrorism program as well as relationships with other unnamed federal agencies. Public sector agencies certainly deal with software supply chain challenges similar to what the private sector sees. A recent report released by the U.S. Department of Homeland Security found that one U.S. government cabinet agency spent months responding to a vulnerability in the library of Apache’s Log4j2, a Java-based logging utility, in part because its security teams had trouble identifying where the vulnerable packages resided within their software environments. The proceeds from Lineaje’s Series A, which bring the startup’s total raised to $27 million, will bolster its efforts to acquire even more U.S. public sector clientele, Hasan continued. “The Series A funding round will cover us until early 2027 at least,” he said, adding that last year was Lineaje’s first year of revenue. “We have about 30 employees currently, with plans to double headcount by the end of the year.” The round was co-led by Prosperity7 Ventures, Neotribe and Hitachi with participation from Tenable Ventures, Carahsoft, Wipro Ventures, SecureOctane and AlumniVentures."

        "content":"Meta’s Threads social network passed the 150 million monthly users mark recently, but the company is not slowing down its growth engine. To increase engagement, the social media giant is running a limited-time bonus program for Threads. Over the last few days, many accounts have posted about this program. The company confirmed to TechCrunch about a limited-time invite-only program for creators, which began testing in March. Meta said that invited creators will have “individualized” requirements for bonuses. At the moment, the program is limited to creators in the U.S. The company said it might expand the program to other regions if successful. On its support page, Meta says that invited creators must make a public Threads profile and follow the rules of Instagram creator incentive terms and rules for bonuses on Instagram. The company specified that the performance of Threads’ posts (views) and the number of posts are some of the parameters for creators to receive bonuses. There are also specific guidelines for what kind of posts would be eligible for the bonus program. For instance, one of the requirements states that a post must receive at least 2,500 views. Apart from that, Threads posts with copyrighted material, no text and boosted views won’t be eligible for bonuses. Meta adds that the content shouldn’t have a watermark of another platform such as TikTok or YouTube. Plus, the posted content shouldn’t be a brand partnership post. Creators can check their earnings on the professional dashboard and they might need to a earn minimum amount to receive a payout. “In some cases, you must earn a minimum amount to receive a bonus payout. If you don’t reach the minimum amount, you will not receive any bonus payout, but you may be invited to participate in another bonus opportunity in the future,” the company explains. This program might push Instagram users with substantial following to post more on Threads and, in turn, also port over some of their following. Instagram already shows suggested Threads on its app. Users might want to check out Meta’s rival X more frequently if their favorite creators are posting on the app. The new bonus program is also a good opportunity for creators who might want to build out an audience on the new platform. However, the monetary benefits might be temporary, as Meta hasn’t detailed long-term plans for creators to earn money on Threads."

        "content":"OpenAI has built a tool that could potentially catch students who cheat by asking ChatGPT to write their assignments — but according to The Wall Street Journal, the company is debating whether to actually release it. In a statement provided to TechCrunch, an OpenAI spokesperson confirmed that the company is researching the text watermarking method described in the Journal’s story, but said it’s taking a “deliberate approach” due to “the complexities involved and its likely impact on the broader ecosystem beyond OpenAI.” “The text watermarking method we’re developing is technically promising, but has important risks we’re weighing while we research alternatives, including susceptibility to circumvention by bad actors and the potential to disproportionately impact groups like non-English speakers,” the spokesperson said. This would be a different approach from most previous efforts to detect AI-generated text, which have been largely ineffective. Even OpenAI itself shut down its previous AI text detector last year due to its “low rate of accuracy.” With text watermarking, OpenAI would focus solely on detecting writing from ChatGPT, not from other companies’ models. It would do so by making small changes to how ChatGPT selects words, essentially creating an invisible watermark in the writing that could later be detected by a separate tool. Following the publication of the Journal’s story, OpenAI also updated a May blog post about its research around detecting AI-generated content. The update says text watermarking has proven “highly accurate and even effective against localized tampering, such as paraphrasing,” but has proven “less robust against globalized tampering; like using translation systems, rewording with another generative model, or asking the model to insert a special character in between every word and then deleting that character.” As a result, OpenAI writes that this method is “trivial to circumvention by bad actors.” OpenAI’s update also echoes the spokesperson’s point about non-English speakers, writing that text watermarking could “stigmatize use of AI as a useful writing tool for non-native English speakers.”"

        "content":"Around 8.5 million devices — less than 1 percent of Windows machines globally — were affected by the recent CrowdStrike outage, according to a Microsoft blog post by David Weston, the company’s vice president of enterprise and OS security. These are the first real numbers released by either Microsoft or CrowdStrike around the scale of yesterday’s outage, which was caused by an update to CrowdStrike’s cybersecurity software that led Windows machines to crash. (Mac and Linux devices were not affected.) Although the number of affected devices was relatively low, the havoc was widespread and global, affecting banks, retailers, brokerage companies, rail networks, and more. Airlines halted flight operations around the world. “While the percentage [of affected devices] was small, the broad economic and societal impacts reflect the use of CrowdStrike by enterprises that run many critical services,” Weston wrote. He did not say what percentage of Windows devices with CrowdStrike software were affected. It’s also worth noting that even if only one computer crashed, it could potentially take down an entire network or data center. Weston also wrote that “although this was not a Microsoft incident,” the company has been working with CrowdStrike to address the issue. Systems could be slow to recover if every affected computer requires a manual fix, but Weston said Microsoft and CrowdStrike have developed “a scalable solution that will help Microsoft’s Azure infrastructure accelerate a fix” and are also collaborating with Amazon Web Services and Google Cloud Platform."

        "content":"Meta has suspended the use of its AI assistant after Brazil’s National Data Protection Authority (ANPD) banned the company from training its AI models on personal data from Brazilians. The move puts a dent in Facebook’s attempt to build out its AI products in Brazil, a market with more than 200 million people. As cited in the official document, the Brazilian authority said that the preventive measure is due to “the imminent risk of serious harm and irreparable or difficult-to-repair damage to the fundamental rights of guardians.” Additionally, the ANPD set a daily fine of 50,000 reais in case of non-compliance. A Meta spokesperson confirmed the decision in a statement to TechCrunch, saying, “We decided to suspend genAI features that were previously live in Brazil while we engage with the ANPD to address their questions around genAI.” Meta has already been training its AI using user-generated content in the U.S. and other markets for several years. But in May, Meta had to pause plans to train its AI models in Europe and the U.K. after the Irish Data Protection Commission pushed back against these plans."

        "content":"Instagram just announced that it will allow users to add multiple audio tracks to their Reels worldwide. The company noted that users can add up to 20 tracks in a single Reel. To add a new track to your video, tap on the “Add to mix” option in the Reel editor. Once you add the tracks, you can trim them to include only the portion of audio you want. “The launch of multitrack audio in Reels gives creators expanded creative flexibility with the ability to visually align audio with elements like text, stickers, and clips to express their creativity in a way that feels right for them and their audience,” the company said in a post. Instagram will attribute the overall combined track to the creator so they can urge their fans to reuse the unique mix. This feature removes the need for creators to use another editor to mix multiple tracks into one and then apply it to their clips. Earlier this month, Instagram head Adam Mosseri said that the platform won’t concentrate on long-form videos and rather will concentrate on users sending each other short videos. “It turns out the long-form video is less symbiotic with these other jobs. If you watch a 10- or 20-minute video, you see less content from friends, you interact with your friends less and you’re actually less likely to send that content or that video to a friend,” Mosseri said in an Instagram Reel. “So we’re not going to go after that business because it’s part of our core identity to connect people with friends, and we don’t want to undermine that by going after long-form video. We understand short-form video doesn’t always do that, but it can.”"

        "content":"Russian cybersecurity giant Kaspersky will lay off dozens of staff and leave the U.S. market following a U.S. government order in June banning the sale of the company’s software, citing security risks. Kaspersky said it will “gradually wind down” its U.S. operations beginning July 20, when the ban comes into effect, adding that its U.S. business is “no longer viable.” Independent journalist Kim Zetter first broke the news on Monday of the company shutting down its stateside business. Zetter said the number of employees affected by the layoffs is “less than 50” in the United States. Kaspersky spokesperson Sawyer VanHorn confirmed the company’s statement and layoffs to TechCrunch in an email Tuesday. The spokesperson was also part of the layoffs, said VanHorn. Kaspersky initially planned to challenge the ban, saying at the time the ban was announced that it “does not engage in activities which threaten U.S. national security,” and that it would “pursue all legally available options to preserve its current operations and relationships.” In June, the U.S. Commerce Department announced the “first of its kind” ban on the sale of Kaspersky’s antivirus software to U.S. consumers, citing increased security and privacy risks because the company is headquartered in Russia. “Russia has shown it has the capacity, and even more than that, the intent to exploit Russian companies like Kaspersky to collect and weaponize the personal information of Americans,” U.S. Commerce Secretary, Gina Raimondo, said in a call with reporters at the time. Once the ban comes into effect, Kaspersky will no longer be allowed to sell its software to U.S. consumers directly or through U.S.-based resellers of Kaspersky software, some of whom have criticized the ban for affecting their businesses. After September 29, Kaspersky will no longer be allowed to push software or security updates to U.S. customers. That will result in degraded protection from the antivirus software. The Commerce Department said it took a staggered approach to the ban to allow U.S. consumers to find an alternative to Kaspersky software. The U.S. Treasury also sanctioned several senior Kaspersky executives, effectively barring U.S. customers from paying Kaspersky for its software or transacting with any future company run by its executives. Chief executive Eugene Kaspersky was not sanctioned, the Treasury said. The U.S. government has acted against Kaspersky during both the Trump and Biden administrations. In 2017, the Trump administration banned the use of Kaspersky software across the federal government after Russian government hackers earlier that year stole U.S. classified documents from an intelligence contractor’s home computer, which was running Kaspersky software at the time. By their nature, antivirus products typically have broad, if not complete, access to the devices they are installed on to identify malicious cyber threats. When seen by TechCrunch on Tuesday, Kaspersky’s products were unavailable for purchase on its U.S. website. “For legal compliance purposes, Kaspersky products cannot be purchased from your country,” its website reads."

The ByteDance-owned short video platform introduced an Artist Account feature last year to let musicians showcase their new music along with their music catalog on the platform and behind-the-scenes footage. Typically, it takes up to 30 days for TikTok to process documents when an artist applies for this tag. Now, TikTok is offering DistroKid Members — who are paying a $22.99 annual subscription fee — to get registered as an artist within hours. “It’s now faster than ever for any artist to create their official TikTok Artist Account directly through DistroKid, reducing the process from weeks to just hours,” said Phil Bauer, president of DistroKid, in a statement. “Building on our long history of collaboration, DistroKid members now have unique access to tools and features for promoting their music on TikTok’s leading discovery platform,” he added. Last October, ByteDance partnered with DistroKid to allow independent artists to directly make their songs available on both TikTok Music and video editing app CapCut. While TikTok and DistroKid have been long-term partners, ByteDance also runs a rival music distribution service called SoundOn, which launched in 2022."

        "content":"A group of researchers say they have uncovered a series of security flaws in different 5G basebands — essentially processors used by cell phones to connect to mobile networks — which could have allowed hackers to stealthily hack victims and spy on them. The researchers from Pennsylvania State University presented their findings at the Black Hat cybersecurity conference in Las Vegas on Wednesday, as well as in an academic paper. Using a custom-made analysis tool they called 5GBaseChecker, the researchers uncovered baseband vulnerabilities made by Samsung, MediaTek, and Qualcomm, which are used in phones made by Google, OPPO, OnePlus, Motorola, and Samsung. The researchers are Kai Tu, Yilu Dong, Abdullah Al Ishtiaq, Syed Md Mukit Rashid, Weixuan Wang, Tianwei Wu, and Syed Rafiul Hussain. On Wednesday, they released 5GBaseChecker on GitHub so that other researchers can use it to hunt for 5G vulnerabilities. Hussain, an assistant professor at Penn State, told TechCrunch that he and his students were able to trick phones with those vulnerable 5G basebands into connecting to a fake base station — essentially a fake cell phone tower — and from there launch their attacks. Tu, one of the students, said that their most critical attack allowed them to exploit the phone from that fake base station. At that point, Tu said, “the security of 5G was totally broken.” “The attack is totally silent,” Tu added. Tu explained that by taking advantage of the vulnerabilities they found, a malicious hacker could pretend to be one of the victim’s friends and send a credible phishing message. Or by directing the victim’s phone to a malicious website, the hacker could trick the victim into providing their credentials on a fake Gmail or Facebook login page, for example. The researchers were also able to downgrade a victim from 5G to older protocols like 4G or even older ones, making it easier to eavesdrop on the victim’s communications, said Tu. The researchers said that most vendors they contacted have fixed the vulnerabilities. At the time of writing, the researchers identified and got patched 12 vulnerabilities in different 5G basebands. Samsung spokesperson Chris Langlois said in a statement to TechCrunch that the company had “released software patches to affected smartphone vendors to address and resolve this matter,” while Google spokesperson Matthew Flegal also confirmed that the flaws were now fixed. MediaTek and Qualcomm did not respond to a request for comment."

        "content":"Google has released a trio of new, “open” generative AI models that it’s calling “safer,” “smaller” and “more transparent” than most — a bold claim, to be sure. They’re additions to Google’s Gemma 2 family of generative models, which debuted back in May. The new models, Gemma 2 2B, ShieldGemma and Gemma Scope, are designed for slightly different applications and use cases, but share in common a safety bent. Google’s Gemma series of models are different from its Gemini models in that Google doesn’t make the source code available for Gemini, which is used by Google’s own products as well as being available to developers. Rather, Gemma is Google’s effort to foster goodwill within the developer community, much like Meta is attempting to do with Llama. Gemma 2 2B is a lightweight model for generating analyzing text that can run on a range of hardware, including laptops and edge devices. It’s licensed for certain research and commercial applications and can be downloaded from sources such as Google’s Vertex AI model library, the data science platform Kaggle and Google’s AI Studio toolkit. As for ShieldGemma, it’s a collection of “safety classifiers” that attempt to detect toxicity like hate speech, harassment and sexually explicit content. Built on top of Gemma 2, ShieldGemma can be used to filter prompts to a generative model as well as content that the model generates. Lastly, Gemma Scope allows developers to “zoom in” on specific points within a Gemma 2 model and make its inner workings more interpretable. Here’s how Google describes it in a blog post: “[Gemma Scope is made up of] specialized neural networks that help us unpack the dense, complex information processed by Gemma 2, expanding it into a form that’s easier to analyze and understand. By studying these expanded views, researchers can gain valuable insights into how Gemma 2 identifies patterns, processes information and ultimately makes predictions.” The release of the new Gemma 2 models comes shortly after the U.S. Commerce Department endorsed open AI models in a preliminary report. Open models broaden generative AI’s availability to smaller companies, researchers, nonprofits and individual developers, the report said, while also highlighting the need for capabilities to monitor such models for potential risks."

        "content":"We’re at a transitional moment in streaming — user growth is slowing and major players are looking to consolidate, but the long-promised dream of profitability finally seems within reach (especially if you’re Netflix). This is the perfect time, then, for The New York Times to interview many of the industry’s big names — including Netflix co-CEO Ted Sarandos, Amazon’s Prime Video head Mike Hopkins, and IAC chairman Barry Diller — about what they think comes next. There seemed to be broad agreement on most of the big themes: More ads, higher prices, and fewer big swings on prestige TV. These changes are all united by the shift toward profitability, rather than growth-at-all-costs. If the initial prices of many streaming services seemed unsustainably low at launch, it turns out they were — prices have been steadily rising, while the streamers have also introduced more affordable subscription tiers for viewers who are willing to watch ads. In fact, some execs told The Times that streamers will keep raising prices for the ad-free tiers with the aim of pushing more customers to sign up for ad-supported subscriptions instead. The growth of ad-supported streaming could also affect the kinds of movies and shows that get produced, since advertisers generally want to reach a mass audience — think of the heyday of ad-supported network TV, with its endless shows about doctors and cops, compared to the more ambitious fare on subscription-supported HBO. That shift is already underway in streaming, though executives insist they’re not abandoning their hopes of finding the next “Sopranos” or “House of Cards.” Sarandos (who’s already been backing away from his decade-old boast that he wanted Netflix “to become HBO before HBO could become us”) said Netflix can “do prestige TV at scale,” but added, “We don’t only do prestige.” Similarly, Hopkins said that at Prime Video, “procedurals and other tried-and-true formats do well for us, but we also need big swings that have customers saying, ‘Wow, I can’t believe that just happened’ and will have people telling their friends.’” Other not-too-surprising predictions include greater investment in live sports (“the simplest and most interesting thing,” according to Warner Bros. Discovery board member John Malone), more bundling, and either the shutdown or merger of some existing services. Apparently there was consensus among the executives that streamers need at least 200 million subscribers to be “big enough to compete,” as former Disney CEO Bob Chapek put it. Some of those changes would be welcome, but they reinforce the sense that streaming — at least as envisioned by the executives currently running the business — won’t be all that different from the old cable TV ecosystem. Some things will be better (on-demand viewing), some will be worse (compensation for writers, actors, and other talent), and there might be different players at the top. But in many ways, it will feel like the same old TV."

TechCrunch understands that iCloud Private Relay’s downtime has affected some Apple users in markets including Europe, India Japan, and the United States since at least Thursday. The sporadic outages are restricting users from accessing the web on the Safari browser and reporting internet connectivity issues on installed apps. Apple’s System Status web page confirms the latest iCloud Private Relay outage and mentions that the service might be “slow or unavailable” for some users. Launched in 2021 specifically for iCloud+ subscribers, iCloud Private Relay helps protect Apple users from online trackers by encrypting traffic going through customer devices. The DNS service sends requests using two separate internet relays to restrict web trackers and internet service providers to profile users by combining their IP addresses, location and browsing activity. It uses the Oblivious DNS-over-HTTPS protocol that Apple designed in collaboration with Cloudflare in 2020. If you are affected by the ongoing iCloud Private Relay outage, you can temporarily switch off the service by going to Settings > Profile > iCloud > Private Relay.

These assistants just aren’t flexible the way people’s brains are. “For example, if you said, ‘Hey, vamos a cenar tonight? See you there!’ iOS would typically ignore the Spanish part if the English keyboard was enabled, or vice versa. This was not ideal for folks who speak in Spanglish. After talking to more folks in the LATAM community I realized this problem was more prevalent than I knew… so I solved it.” Silvia is one of those little apps that pops up from the left side of your keyboard, so you just tap that instead of the native dictation icon. Then you’ll be able to speak in your favored mixture of languages, and it will type that right out for you. It supports only Spanish and English at first, but with French, Romanian, Ukrainian, German, and Dutch coming soon. There will also be a custom keyboard version so you can use it in non-Apple apps. I asked whether we’d see a version for Hindi and English, another common mixture, but Singh said that, for now, the approach only works for Germanic languages that use the Roman alphabet. Curious how he built it so quickly? Well, he’s already an engineer working in this space, of course, but really, the APIs are pretty strong here and he has deployed them cleverly. “I’m currently using the new Translation API in iOS 18 to create two mono-channels for Spanish and English and then using OpenAI Whisper in parallel to do cleaning up, hence it works lightning fast,” he explained. It doesn’t store any data, by the way, so don’t worry that this is some kind of shady play. It’s Apple-approved. Unlike pretty much every other AI product out there, this one doesn’t claim to change the world — just reflect it a little more accurately. You’ll be able to download Silvia at the end of the month here, or sign up to get notified when it’s out if you’re forgetful, like me."
